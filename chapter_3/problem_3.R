# 3.3. The uniform distribution is a special case of the beta distribution.
# 1. What are the numeric values of its parameters? That is,
# U(0, 1) = Beta(?, ?)

#beta(1,1) = [gamma(2)/(gamma(1) + gamma(1))] * x^0 * (1-x)^0
# each term equals 1

# 2. What is the equivalent prior sample size for a U(0, 1) prior?

#it's the equivelent of a sample size of two, with one 'success'....basically a .5 ratio,
#sort of like assuming nothing in the beginnings
